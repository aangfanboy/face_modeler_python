# What is it works?

It is a Python script that able to mark human face's and draw lines on it. With this, you can develop face recognition algorithms.

# What I need to use?

You just need [shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat](https://github.com/AKSHAYUBHAT/TensorFace/blob/master/openface/models/dlib/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat) . dlib needs this.

# How I can use?

If you downloaded [shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat](https://github.com/AKSHAYUBHAT/TensorFace/blob/master/openface/models/dlib/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat), you can start. If you want to try on images, you must type path of image folder to 'PATH' variable on line 364 and mark 'on_cam()' as a comment line on line 419. But if you want to try on your webcam, you must mark 'on_path(PATH)' as a comment line on line 418. Then you are ready to start!
